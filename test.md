This is a perfectly valid and very common JavaScript function named `sum`.

Here's what it does:

1.  **`function sum(x, y)`**:
    *   `function`: This keyword declares that you are defining a function.
    *   `sum`: This is the name of the function.
    *   `(x, y)`: These are the parameters (or arguments) that the function expects to receive when it's called. `x` and `y` are placeholders for the values you'll pass in.

2.  **`{ return x + y; }`**:
    *   `{ ... }`: This defines the body of the function, containing the code that will be executed.
    *   `return`: This keyword specifies the value that the function will output or "return" when it finishes execution.
    *   `x + y`: This is the operation performed. It adds the values of the two parameters `x` and `y` together.

**In essence, this function takes two numbers, adds them together, and then gives you the result of that addition.**

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
function sum(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

// Calling the function and storing the result
let result1 = sum(5, 3);
console.log(result1); // Output: 8

let result2 = sum(10, -2);
console.log(result2); // Output: 8

// Calling it directly in a log
console.log(sum(0, 0)); // Output: 0
```

**Alternative (modern JavaScript using an Arrow Function):**

You can write the same function more concisely using an arrow function:

```javascript
const sum = (x, y) => x + y;

// Example usage is the same:
console.log(sum(7, 12)); // Output: 19
```

This function is a fundamental example of how to encapsulate a specific task (addition) into a reusable block of code, making your programs more organized and efficient.
